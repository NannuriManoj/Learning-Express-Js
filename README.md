# JavaScript Backend Learning Repository

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice with JavaScript backend development, focusing on Node.js, Express.js, and RESTful concepts. All code in this repository is written to understand backend fundamentals through practical implementation.

The goal of this repository is to learn how HTTP servers work using Node.js and Express, understand the request–response lifecycle, differentiate between HTTP methods such as GET and POST, and apply REST principles while building backend features.

Tech stack used includes JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and npm.

To run the server, install dependencies using `npm install`, then start the server using:

node index.js

After starting the server, open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:3000


## Learning Methodology

- Focused on concept clarity rather than advanced features  
- Uses in-memory data instead of databases  
- Small practice projects for each concept  
- REST concepts introduced progressively  
- Code is intentionally kept readable and simple  

## Current Limitations

- No database integration yet  
- No authentication or authorization  
- No advanced error handling  
- Intended strictly for learning purposes  

## Future Improvements

- Full CRUD implementation (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)  
- REST APIs with JSON responses  
- Database integration (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)  
- MVC architecture  
- Authentication basics  
- API testing using Postman
