# JavaScript Backend Learning Repository

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in JavaScript backend development, with a strong focus on Node.js, Express.js, RESTful routing, and server-side rendering using EJS.

The project is built step by step to understand how backend systems work internally, with emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and practical implementation rather than advanced abstractions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Understand how HTTP servers work using Node.js and Express
- Learn the request–response lifecycle
- Practice RESTful routing and CRUD operations
- Work with HTML forms and HTTP methods
- Understand data flow between routes, middleware, and views
- Build strong backend fundamentals through hands-on practice

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered So Far

- Node.js server fundamentals  
- Express.js routing and middleware  
- RESTful route design  
- HTTP methods:
  - GET (Read)
  - POST (Create)
  - PATCH (Update)
  - DELETE (Delete)
- Route parameters (`req.params`)
- Form data handling (`req.body`)
- `method-override` for PATCH and DELETE
- Server-side rendering using EJS
- Dynamic routing using IDs
- In-memory data handling
- POST → Redirect → GET pattern
- Basic error prevention using guards

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- JavaScript  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)  
- npm  
- method-override

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
node index.js
```

3. Open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 📁 Project Characteristics

- Uses in-memory data (no database yet)
- Implements full CRUD functionality
- Follows RESTful URL conventions
- Server-side rendering with EJS
- Code is clean, readable, and well-commented
- Designed strictly for learning purposes

---

## 📌 Learning Methodology

- Focus on concept clarity over advanced features
- No shortcuts or heavy abstractions
- Each feature implemented manually
- Errors treated as learning opportunities
- Strong emphasis on understanding the "why"

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- No database integration
- No authentication or authorization
- Minimal error handling
- Not production-ready
- Intended only for learning and practice

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- REST APIs with JSON responses
- Database integration (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- MVC architecture
- Authentication and authorization basics
- Better error handling and 404 pages
- API testing using Postman
- Input validation and sanitization
